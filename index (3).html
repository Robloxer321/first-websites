<h2 style = "color: black">I learned about the functions of the Micro-Bit's and their possiblities. I learned that there are many different things you could do with Micro-Bits, they ca be used as the base to control other things like servos. When talkng about servos, i could talk about our final project. We created a code where we use tilt control to control multiple servos to go in different directions. </h2>
    
<center><h1 style="background-color: darkorange">What were some difficulties?</h1></center>
<h2 style="color: black">I encountered many problems and obstacles along the way. We had problems with our communications because we all had different ideas and solutions to our problems so we got into each other's way. When we tried to input our different solutions into the codingwe had tiny conflicts in which led time being wasted. We also encountered a fatty problem when we couldn't figure out how to make tilt control work for our servos.</h2>
